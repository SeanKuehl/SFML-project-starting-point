# SFML-project-starting-point
A MSVS project set up with all the dlls linked up as well as a sprite class, font, button and text classes and a simple pong example. The starting point for a future project in sfml.

NOTE: because I put this up with git, it won't have the DLLs in the folder with the exe which it needs to work. So in order to get it to work, I'll need to put the needed sfml dlls into the same folder as the exe.
